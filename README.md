# CrowdFood-iOS
:v: CrowdFood iOS app written by Swift. :trophy: The app won the [2nd Place](http://devpost.com/software/crowdfood) in [HackNC](http://hacknc.com/) 2015. :trophy:

### Inspiration
We can easily find lots of information from online service to schedule our daily activities. But it is not enough, we still miss one more thing. We cannot estimate how much time we need to find a seat in our favorite restaurant, especially during lunch and dinner time. So far, there is no an easy solution for this problem.

### What can CrowdFood do?
* CrowdFood crowdsources the estimation of the waiting time in a restaurant. It will be particularly useful during the peak time.
* This valuable information collected from the users who are already in the restaurant.
